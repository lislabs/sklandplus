# `@sklandplus/openapi-hypergryph-as`

This package is used to generate the OpenAPI 3.1 schema for the API. Users who wish to use the API directly should refer
to the [`@sklandplus/client`](../client/README.md) package instead.

For usage and contribution guides, please refer to [`@sklandplus/openapi`](../openapi/README.md).
The structure of these two packages is the same.

The main difference between this package and `@sklandplus/openapi` is, `@sklandplus/openapi` focuses on the API of
Skland, which belongs to `https://zonai.skland.com`, while this package focuses on `https://as.hypergryph.com`, which is
the API of HyperGryph.

### What does the "as" in the package name mean? 

Honestly, I have no idea either. The "as" is the prefix of `https://as.hypergryph.com`, so I just take it.
